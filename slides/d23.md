# P3D9: Programming with spatial data (Python)

_These slides map to the R example slides on [Day 17 or P3D3](d17.md)_
## Getting spatial tools onto our computers

First we need to make sure we have the spatial tools, mainly [GDAL](https://gdal.org/), on our computers.
### Macs

If you are having issues on the mac, I recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1. Paste the below code into your Terminal.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. After you have Hombrew installed you can run the following brew commands in your Terminal.

```bash
brew install gdal
```

You could also use [KyngChaos's `.dmg`](https://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks/#gdal_complete) file.

3. Within our interactive python window run the following

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pyarrow folium mapclassify geopandas rtree
```
### Windows

You will most likely have issues on a Windows computer.  I like to avoid using anaconda which is one option that GeoPandas recommends.  We should be able to get everything working using the following commands.

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install wheel pipwin pyarrow folium mapclassify rtree
!{sys.executable} -m pipwin install gdal 
!{sys.executable} -m pipwin install pyproj
!{sys.executable} -m pipwin install fiona
!{sys.executable} -m pipwin install shapely
!{sys.executable} -m pip install geopandas # notice this isn't pipwin
```

Thanks to [JDOaktown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54734667/error-installing-geopandas-a-gdal-api-version-must-be-specified-in-anaconda) and Manuel for the above process.
## Finding spatial data

### Move from R

Install the pertinent packages. We probably just need the third package [`sfarrow`](https://github.com/wcjochem/sfarrow).

> `sfarrow` is a package for reading and writing Parquet and Feather files
with `sf` objects using `arrow` in `R`.

> Simple features are a popular format for representing spatial vector
data using `data.frames` and a list-like geometry column, implemented in
the `R` package [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). Apache Parquet
files are an open-source, column-oriented data storage format
(<https://parquet.apache.org/>) which enable efficient read/writing for
large files. Parquet files are becoming popular across programming
languages and can be used in `R` using the package
[`arrow`](https://github.com/apache/arrow/).

> The `sfarrow` implementation translates simple feature data objects
using well-known binary (WKB) format for geometries and reads/writes
Parquet/Feather files. A key goal of the package is for interoperability
of the files (particularly with Python `GeoPandas`), so coordinate
reference system information is maintained in a standard metadata format
(<https://github.com/geopandas/geo-arrow-spec>). Note to users: this
metadata format is not yet stable for production uses and may change in
the future.

```R
remotes::install_github("ropensci/USAboundaries")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/USAboundariesData")
install.packages("sfarrow")
```

Load our libraries.

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(USAboundaries)
library(sf)
library(sfarrow)
```

Get the data from `USAboundaries`

```R
usa <- USAboundaries::us_boundaries() %>%
    st_transform(4326)

usa_counties <- USAboundaries::us_counties() %>%
    select(-state_name) %>%
    st_transform(4326)

usa_cities <- USAboundaries::us_cities() %>%
    st_transform(4326)
```

Write the data out to the `.parquet` and `.feather` formats.

```R
sfarrow::st_write_feather(usa, "data/usa.feather")
sfarrow::st_write_parquet(usa, "data/usa.parquet")

sfarrow::st_write_feather(usa_counties, "data/usa_counties.feather")
sfarrow::st_write_parquet(usa_counties, "data/usa_counties.parquet")

sfarrow::st_write_feather(usa_cities, "data/usa_cities.feather")
sfarrow::st_write_parquet(usa_cities, "data/usa_cities.parquet")
```
### Download from internet

Using R to get spatial data probably isn't the most optimal path.  However, I highly recommend the simple feature arrow format for storing and sharing spatial data within Python and R.  We can also download data from the internet and load the files.

- We can load geo.json files.  Here is one for [Cobb Count](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries/USA/GA/Cobb.geo.json)
- Most government institutions use ArcGIS shape files.  Here are files from the US Census: [Cartographic Boundary Files - Shapefile](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).  They provide details on the files and data at their [Cartographic Boundary File Description](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html).

## Leveraging the GeoPandas

GeoPandas has a great [User Guide](https://geopandas.org/docs/user_guide.html) to help us get started. We should have everything installed based on the installation guides above. Now we can load our libraries.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import geopandas as gpd
```

### `gpd.read_file()`

#### From zipped Shapefiles

ESRI- ArcGIS defined the format.

> A shapefile is an Esri vector data storage format for storing the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features. It is stored as a set of related files and contains one feature class. Shapefiles often contain large features with a lot of associated data and historically have been used in GIS desktop applications such as ArcMap.

> The primary way to make shapefile data available for others to view through a web browser is to add it to a .zip file, upload it, and publish a hosted feature layer. The .zip file must contain at least the .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files components of the shapefile.

> [arcGIS](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/shapefiles.htm)

```Python
census_url  = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip"
county_shp = gpd.read_file(census_url)
```

#### From GeoJSON files

[County GeoJSON files](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/tree/master/countries/USA) for [Cobb county](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries/USA/GA/Cobb.geo.json) provide enough of an example.

```python
cobb_url = "https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/raw/master/countries/USA/GA/Cobb.geo.json"
cobb_gj = gpd.read_file(cobb_url)
```

#### From `.parquet` or `.feather` geo files

We can use either format based on [GeoPandas documentation](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/io.html#feather).

```python
usa = gpd.read_parquet("data/usa.parquet")
county = gpd.read_parquet("data/usa_counties.parquet")
cities = gpd.read_parquet("data/usa_cities.parquet")
```

### Getting lat and long columns to spatial objects

Let's load our SafeGraph data on Chipotle stores and convert the `latitude` and `longitude` to a `geometry` column.

```python
# you may need to change your file path.
dat = pd.read_csv("SafeGraph - Patterns and Core Data - Chipotle - July 2021/Core Places and Patterns Data/chipotle_core_poi_and_patterns.csv")

dat_sp = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    dat.filter(["placekey", "latitude", "longitude", "median_dwell"]), 
    geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(
        dat.longitude,
        dat.latitude))
```

### Plotting polygons and points

Let's plot our polygons using the GeoPandas methods.

```python
import folium
from plotnine import *
```

#### matplotlib

- [Maps with layers](https://geopandas.org/docs/user_guide/mapping.html#maps-with-layers)

```python
county = gpd.read_parquet("data/usa_counties.parquet")
c48=county.query('stusps not in ["HI", "AK", "PR"]')

base = c48.plot(color="white", edgecolor="darkgrey")
dat_sp.plot(ax=base, color="red", markersize=5)
```

#### Folium

They also have an interactive option that depends on [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html) which leverages leaflet.js like the leaflet package in R. We need to install some additional dependencies.

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install folium matplotlib mapclassify
```

Now we can build interactive plots using a similar structure as above.

- `.explore()` [arguments](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.explore.html#geopandas.GeoDataFrame.explore)



```python
dat_sp_lt100 = dat_sp.query("median_dwell < 100")
c48 = county.query('statusps not in ["HI", "AK", "PR"]')

# %%
base_inter = c48.explore(
    style_kwds = {"fill":False, 
        "color":"darkgrey",
        "weight":.4}
)

theplot=dat_sp_lt100.explore(
    m=base_inter,
    column='median_dwell',
    cmap="Set1",
    marker_kwds={"radius":2, "fill":True},
    style_kwds={"fillOpacity":1})

folium.TileLayer('Stamen Toner', control=True).add_to(base_inter)  # use folium to add alternative tiles
folium.LayerControl().add_to(base_inter)  

theplot
```

If we want to get the plot out of the interactive viewer we save the map object as an `.html` file and open the file in our web browser.

```python
theplot.save("map.html")
```

### Manipulating geometries

- What units are the `awater` and `aland` variables in?
- Does `aland` include `awater`?

We need to [manage the projection](https://geopandas.org/docs/user_guide/projections.html) to get the projection into meters for the units and then [calculate the area](https://geopandas.org/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.area.html).

```python
c48 = c48.assign(
    aland_calc = c48.geometry.to_crs(epsg = 3310).area
)
```

Now we can plot the two columns.

```python
(ggplot(c48, aes(
    x="aland_calc/aland",
    fill="awater")) + 
geom_histogram())
```
