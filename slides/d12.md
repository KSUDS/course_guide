### Big Data and the Underground Railroad

[Big Data and the Underground Railroad](https://slate.com/technology/2014/11/big-data-underground-railroad-history-says-unfettered-collection-of-data-is-a-bad-idea.html) from Slate.com.

> There is a moral lag in the way we treat data. Far too often, today’s discrimination was yesterday’s national security or public health necessity. An approach that advocates ubiquitous data collection and protects privacy solely through post-collection use restrictions doesn’t account for that.

> These examples may seem extreme. But they highlight an important and uncomfortable fact: Throughout our history, the survival of our most vulnerable communities has often turned on their ability to avoid detection.

> The problem is not that the proponents of big data are nefarious—they’re not. The problem is that all of us, as a society, are startlingly bad at protecting the data of vulnerable communities, and recognizing when use of that data crosses a line.

### Imperative and Declarative

> With an imperative approach, a developer writes code that specifies the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal. This is sometimes referred to as *algorithmic* programming. In contrast, a functional approach involves composing the problem as a set of functions to be executed. -[ref](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/linq/functional-vs-imperative-programming#:~:text=Functional%20programming%20is%20a%20form,support%20imperative%20(procedural)%20programming.)-

This [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1784664/what-is-the-difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-paradigm-in-programmin) provides some great examples.
#### Imperative examples

1. __Imperative__ goes to a restaurant and orders a 6oz. steak (cooked rare), fries (with ketchup), a side-salad (with ranch), and a Coke (with no ice). The waiter delivers exactly what he asked for, and he's charged $14.50. 
2. __Imperative:__ Librarian please 1) Go into the Library, 2) Find Book Organization System, 3) Research how to use Card Catalogs, 5) Figure out how shelves are labeled and organized, 6) Figure out how books are organized on a shelf, 7) Cross-reference book location from card catalog with organization system to find said book. 8) Take book to check-out system, 9) Check out book for me.
3. __Imperative__ directions say, “Go to 1st Street, turn left onto Main, drive two blocks, turn right onto Maple, and stop at the third house on the left.”
4. __Imperative__ language is when you say *how* to get what you want.
5. In English _Imperative_ sentences give a command or make some sort of request.

#### Declarative examples

1. __Declarative__ goes to a restaurant and tells the waiter that he only wants to pay around 12 dollars for dinner, and he's in the mood for steak. The waiter returns with a 6oz. steak (cooked medium), a side of mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, a dinner roll, and a glass of water. He's charged $11.99.
2. __Declarative:__ Librarian, please check me out a copy of Moby Dick. (Librarian, at their discretion chooses the best method for performing the request)
3. __Declarative__ directions are something like this: “Drive to Sue’s house.”
4. __Declarative__ language is when you say *what* you want.
5. In English __Declarative__ sentences state something. 

### Don't I live in a state?

Understanding the phrase 'state changes' in computer science can be a bit complicated (and I know I don't have it completely right). I think we could use Pandas to help us understand the concept (although this example is technically not a state change) When we make a variable assignment in Python we create a _state_ in our code.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, np.nan]})
```

When we assign `df`to a new object we have created a new _state_ in our code. It can even be the same _'thing'_ to our minds. However, the program sees them as two different objects.

```python
df2 = df
```

Pandas does have some methods that perform _state changes_ (no explicit assignment using `=`) which are accessed with the `inplace=True`.

```python
df.fillna(0, inplace=False)
df2.fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

Now, compare `df` to `df2`. The state of `df2` was changed without an explicit `=`.
### Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

[A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) is a great free resource to get the basics of Python. I am going to quote this book heavily below.
#### Lists

> The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.

```python
mylist = ["toast", "butter", "cheese", "dig a whole"]
```
#### Tuples

> Think of them as similar to lists, but without the extensive functionality that the list class gives you. One major feature of tuples is that they are immutable like strings i.e. you cannot modify tuples. Tuples are defined by specifying items separated by commas within an optional pair of parentheses (`()`).

```python
mytupple = ("thing1", "thing2")
```
#### Dictionary

> A dictionary is like an address-book where you can find the address (value) or contact details of a person by knowing only his/her name (key). The key must be unique just like the limitations of getting correct response if you have two persons with the exact same name when calling on them.

Pairs of keys and values are specified in a dictionary by using the colons (`:`) to match each pair using curly brackets (`{}`). The pairs are separated by commas.

```python
my_dictionary = {'col1': 1, 'col2': 3}
```

#### Pandas examples

Notice how we create our DataFrames using these tools.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, np.nan]})
```

```python
data = [('Peter', 18, 7),
        ('Riff', 15, 6),
        ('John', 17, 8),
        ('Michel', 18, 7),
        ('Sheli', 17, 5) ]
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data, columns =['Name', 'Age', 'Score'])
```

### List comprehension (Pythonista)

Real Python provides a clear guide on [list comprehension](https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/).

> 1. List comprehensions are often described as being more Pythonic than loops.
> 2. One main benefit of using a list comprehension in Python is that it’s a single tool that you can use in many different situations.
> 3. List comprehensions are also more declarative than loops, which means they’re easier to read and understand.

#### An example

What will the list `prices` be?

```python
original_prices = [1.25, -9.45, 10.22, 3.78, -5.92, 1.16]
prices = [i if i > 0 else 0 for i in original_prices]
```

Same process using functions

```python
def get_price(price):
    return price if price > 0 else 0
prices = [get_price(i) for i in original_prices]
prices
```

### Functions in Python

> Functions are reusable pieces of programs. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword. After this keyword comes an identifier name for the function, followed by a pair of parentheses (`()`) which may enclose some names of variables, and by the final colon (`:`) that ends the line. Next follows the block of statements that are part of this function which are tab spaced one indent.

```python
def magic_calcs(myDF):
    a = myDF.mean()
    return(a)
```
