# P3D1: Spatiotemporal Data

The data for our [third project](https://github.com/KSUDS/p3_spatial) is both spatial and temporal. In addition, we are obligated to identify a business use case. Finally, you will work in a team on this project (which means your team will use the same repository).

## Preventing gun deaths

__Find a partner that you would like to work with on project 3 and discuss your proposal for how the marketing companies should support the reduction in Gun deaths.__

1. Share your charts that tell your story.
2. Compare and contrast your charts.
3. Discuss your python implementation of the data parsing function.

## Connecting to your repo and SafeGraph

### Personal folders, branches, or forks

I am familiar with three ways to collaborate using git and Github. We will use option 1.  [This article](https://medium.com/anne-kerrs-blog/using-git-and-github-for-team-collaboration-e761e7c00281) explains option 3. 

1. Create a `personal` folder in the repo and then create a `personName` folder within the `personal` folder for each person on the project.
2. Have one primary repository on Github and require the team to use Forks. [Read here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) for more details.
3. Create branches within the primary repository where each team member can work on their own code base. [Read here](https://medium.com/anne-kerrs-blog/using-git-and-github-for-team-collaboration-e761e7c00281) for more details.

#### Create one repo for your team in our organization

1. One team member creates the repo from our project template.
2. They add the other team members with at least the ability to _write_ to the repo.
3. One of the team adds a `personal` folder with a `readme.md` in the folder.
4. Each team member adds a `personName` folder with an empty `.R` and `.py` script in their folders.

### SafeGraph

__let's join__

[SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/) claims to be the _'source of truth for places data'_ and they allow [college faculty and students free use of their data](https://www.safegraph.com/academics). I have [downloaded data for Marietta and Kennesaw](https://github.com/KSUDS/safegraph_data) that we can use to get experience with the complexity of spatial-temporal data. However, you can elect to pull data for your own location or Point of Interest (POI) type using SafeGraph as well.

## Visualizing space and time

> In his iconic flow map of Napoleon’s catastrophic 1812 invasion of Russia, Charles Joseph Minard blends and bends temporal and spatial representations. The path and number of outward-bound soldiers is represented by an initially thick tan ribbon while the dwindling numbers of retreating survivors are represented by a narrowing black band. In this visualization, the time it took to march into Russia is not clear. The only time stamps shown are for the return trip and progressing from right to left. In a sense, time is “bent” to advance the impact of the visual narrative.
