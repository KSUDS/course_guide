# P4D2: Cleaning data for scikit-learn and machine learning
## What is scikit-learn?

_Let's review a few items from [last class](d27.md#ml-newbie-mistakes)._

> `scikit-learn` is an open source project, meaning that it is free to use and distribute, and anyone can easily obtain the source code to see what is going on behind the scenes. The `scikit-learn` project is constantly being developed and improved, and it has a very active user community. It contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, as well as comprehensive [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation) about each algorithm. `scikit-learn` is a very popular tool, and the most prominent Python library for machine learning. It is widely used in industry and academia, and a wealth of tutorials and code snippets are available online.
> [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller, Sarah Guido](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/ch01.html)

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn pandas pillow
```

Then we can start our script as follows

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn import metrics
```

## I want to start making predictions.

Let's...

1. [create our repo from the template](https://github.com/KSUDS/p4_machinelearning) and clone it.
2. [download the `.csv` data](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-real-property-sales-book-2013). It is small enough that we can version it with our code.
3. Start our `eda.py` script and import our data.

    ```python
    dat = pd.read_csv('SalesBook_2013.csv')
    # select variables we will use in class.
    # drop homes that are not single family or duplexes
    dat_ml = (dat
        .filter(['NBHD', 'PARCEL', 'LIVEAREA', 'FINBSMNT',  
            'BASEMENT', 'YRBUILT', 'CONDITION', 'QUALITY',
            'TOTUNITS', 'STORIES', 'GARTYPE', 'NOCARS',
            'NUMBDRM', 'NUMBATHS', 'ARCSTYLE', 'SPRICE',
            'DEDUCT', 'NETPRICE', 'TASP', 'SMONTH',
            'SYEAR', 'QUALIFIED', 'STATUS'])
        .rename(columns=str.lower)
        .query('totunits <= 2'))
    ```
4. Write a short paragraph describing your data. What does a row represent? What measures do we have for each row?
5. look at our variables/features and imagine which ones might be good predictors of the age of a house.
6. find our target variable. What do we need to do with our target?
7. create a few plots of potential predictors colored by built before 1980 status.
8. fix our character or categorical variables?
    - Which are nominal and which are ordinal?
    - What is `pd.get_dummies()` default behavior for the columns that are created? Should we change that behavior?
    - What do we do with the ordinal variables (`condition`)?
10. fix our columns with missing values?
11. split our data - `train_test_split()`.
12. decide on an ML method would we like to use.
13. fit our model.
14. evaluate our model.

### Creating our target variable

- [`np.where()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html)
- [`assign()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)

### Handling ordinal categories

_What ordinal variables do we have?_

- [`.replace()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.replace.html)
- [`.astype('float')`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.astype.html)

```python
dat_ml.condition.value_counts()
replace_dictionary = {
    "Excel":3,
    "Poor":-2,
}
dat_ml.condition.replace(replace_dictionary)
```

There should be some thought to replacing ordinal values. [Evaluating methods for handling missing ordinal data in structural equation modeling](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-018-1187-4) discusses the topic.

### Handling nominal categories

_What nominal variables do we have?_ _Which have too many categories?_

- [`pd.get_dummies()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html)
- [`.fillna()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html#pandas.DataFrame.fillna)
- [`.str.contains()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.contains.html)

### Fixing our missing values

- [`.fillna()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html#pandas.DataFrame.fillna)


### Building our training and testing data

- [`train_test_split()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)

```python
X_pred = dat_ml.drop(<column list>, axis = 1)
y_pred = dat_ml.filter([<target column>])

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_pred, y_pred, test_size = .34, random_state = 76)  
```

### Fit, Predict, Evaluate

- [Classification models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)
- [`GaussianNB()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes)
- [`.fit()`, `.predict()`, `.predict_proba()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#different-objects)
- [Evaluate or score your model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)
- [`classification_report()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html)
