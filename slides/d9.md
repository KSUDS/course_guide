# P2D1: Getting data and gun deaths

## Partner presentations (10 minutes).

_Find a partner in the class and share your project 1 code and charts._

- Compare your work to identify different ways that each of you completed the job.
- Discuss with each other how long it took for you to complete each chart.
- Share any cool google resources that you have found while completing the project.

## Navigating Github and R packages

- [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) and Github R packages like [waffle](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle) and [beeswarm](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm)
- [full_data.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/full_data.csv) url link for `read_csv()`.

## Exploring gun deaths

__What is the problem with raw counts and minority groups?__

```r
#' Used this information to build the values.
# https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/POP010220
dat_pop <- tibble(
    table_var = c("Asian/Pacific Islander",  
        "Black",  "Hispanic",  
        "Native American/Native Alaskan",  "White"), 
    N =  331449281 *c(.061, .134, .185, .013, .763))
```

__What are some solutions to displaying this small population impact? Issues with those solutions?__

## The plague of bar charts

> It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their inquiries to Averages, and do not revel in more comprehensive views. Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the native of one of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland was that, if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two nuisances would be got rid of at once.

__The problem with bar charts:__

- _They display summaries of data, not the data._
- _They make it hard to visualize uncertainty._
- _They don't facilitate easy comparisons beyond one category._
- _They should be avoided with time-series data_

## Munging data with dplyr

- [count()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)
- [left_join()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html)
- [case_when()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html)

### Understanding `case_when()`

`case_when()` is particularly useful inside mutate when you want to create a new variable that relies on a complex combination of existing variables. __Write a short sentence that says what this code is doing?__

```r
starwars %>%
  select(name:mass, gender, species) %>%
  mutate(
    type = case_when(
      height > 200 | mass > 200 ~ "large",
      species == "Droid"        ~ "robot",
      TRUE                      ~  "other"
    )
  )

#> # A tibble: 87 x 6
#>                  name height  mass gender species  type
#>                 <chr>  <int> <dbl>  <chr>   <chr> <chr>
#>  1     Luke Skywalker    172    77   male   Human other
#>  2              C-3PO    167    75   <NA>   Droid robot
#>  3              R2-D2     96    32   <NA>   Droid robot
