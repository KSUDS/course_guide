## Understanding joins

The [Relational Data chapter of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#relational-data) provides clear details on joins in R.

- [Mutating joins](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#mutating-joins) are the primary joins and I almost always use a [dplyr::left_join()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html). _A mutating join allows you to combine variables from two tables. It first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one table to the other._
- [Understanding types of joins](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#understanding-joins)
- [Problems with duplicate keys](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#join-matches)
- [Mapping terminology](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#other-implementations)

### Join for our project

```r
dat <- read_csv("https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/raw/master/full_data.csv") %>%
    select(-X1)

dat_counts <- dat %>%
    count(race, year)
#' Used this information to build the values.
# https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/POP010220
dat_pop <- tibble(
    table_var = c("Asian/Pacific Islander",  
        "Black",  "Hispanic",  
        "Native American/Native Alaskan",  "White"), 
    N =  331449281 *c(.061, .134, .185, .013, .763))
```

## Waffle Chart Example

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(waffle)

httpgd::hgd()
httpgd::hgd_browse()

storms %>% 
  filter(year >= 2010) %>% 
  count(year, status) -> storms_df

ggplot(storms_df, aes(fill = status, values = n)) +
  geom_waffle(color = "white", size = .25, n_rows = 10, flip = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~year, nrow = 1, strip.position = "bottom") +
  scale_x_discrete() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x * 10, # make this multiplyer the same as n_rows
                     expand = c(0,0)) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(name=NULL) +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(
    title = "Faceted Waffle Bar Chart",
    subtitle = "{dplyr} storms data",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_line()) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
```


## Using Heatmaps to display data

- [Heatmap background](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/heatmap.html)
- [GGplot2 code](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/79-levelplot-with-ggplot2.html)
- [Dealing with labels](https://github.com/wilkox/ggfittext)
- [ggplot2 themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfittext)

httpgd::hgd()
httpgd::hgd_browse()

storms %>% 
  count(year, status) -> storms_df_all

storms_df_all %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = status, fill = n)) +
    geom_tile()  
```

## Getting data for 2016-2019

Let's look at the [CDC_parser.R script](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/CDC_parser.R). 

### Configuring our `.gitignore`

This file is a part of the secret sauce of Git.  [Pluralsight provides a clean description](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file) for our conversation.

In our case, we want to ignore the `data/` folder to limit large file issues with our repository.

### Leveraging functions

> You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code). [functions R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)

### Fixing their `CDC_parser()` function

1. add a `folder_path` argument.
2. document our function with [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/)

```r
#' Pull CDC Death data
#' @param
```

### Understanding temp files and downloads

```r
temp <- tempfile()
download.file(url, temp, quiet = T)
```
