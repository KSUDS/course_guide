# P4D4: Model Explainers R

We are going to leverage the [DALEX R Package](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/). There are other packages like [fastshap](https://github.com/bgreenwell/fastshap) and [iml](https://christophm.github.io/iml/) as well. We are using DALEX based on [recommendations from Tidymodels developers](https://twitter.com/robbins_ave/status/1374777352740167681).

## The book

Przemyslaw Biecek and Tomasz Burzykowski provide [a textbook](https://ema.drwhy.ai/) that covers the DALEX package and the mathematics behind the functions. We don't have time to discuss the mechanics and nuance provided in the book today.

## The code

### Setup

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(DALEX)
library(vip)
library(patchwork)


httpgd::hgd()
httpgd::hgd_browse()
```

I want to remove large square footage homes from our previous `model_ml` object and fit to a subset of the variables.

```r
dat_ml <- read_rds("dat_ml.rds") %>%
    select(arcstyle_ONE.AND.HALF.STORY, arcstyle_ONE.STORY, numbaths,
        tasp, livearea, basement, condition, stories, quality, before1980) %>%
    filter(livearea < 5500) # 99th percentile is 5429.04
```

### Train/Test

Now we can split our data. Notice that we have to create a new `dat_exp` that has our target as a `0/1` object.  Also, notice that `0` is before1980.

```r
set.seed(76)
dat_split <- initial_split(dat_ml, prop = 2/3, strata = before1980)

dat_train <- training(dat_split)
dat_test <- testing(dat_split)
dat_exp <- mutate(dat_train, before1980 = as.integer(dat_train$before1980) - 1)

head(dat_e$before1980)
head(dat_train$before1980)
```

### Model fit

The naive Bayes model didn't work well. Let's just use the logistic and xgboost model.

```r
bt_model <- boost_tree() %>%
    set_engine(engine = "xgboost") %>%
    set_mode("classification") %>%
    fit(before1980 ~ ., data = dat_train)

logistic_model <- logistic_reg() %>%
    set_engine(engine = "glm") %>%
    set_mode("classification") %>%
    fit(before1980 ~ ., data = dat_train)

vip(bt_model)
vip(logistic_model)
```

### DALEX: Model explanation

We need to build our explainer objects using the DALEX package.

- Notice that we have to remove our target and then use the `0/1` target from `dat_exp`.

```r
explainer_bt <- DALEX::explain(
    bt_model,
    select(dat_exp, -before1980), dat_exp$before1980, label = "Boosted Trees")

explainer_logistic <- DALEX::explain(
    logistic_model,
    select(dat_exp, -before1980), dat_exp$before1980, label = "Logistic Regression")
```

### DALEX: Model performance

We can use the two model residual plots to compare our two models.

```r
performance_logistic <- model_performance(explainer_logistic)
performance_bt <- model_performance(explainer_bt)

plot(performance_bt, performance_logistic)
plot(performance_bt, performance_logistic, geom = "boxplot")

```

We can also look at the feature importance comparison as well. Notice that the feature importance and ordering are a bit different than those shown by `vip()`. We have defined the `loss_function` that is different from the default.

```r
logistic_parts <- model_parts(explainer_logistic, 
    loss_function = loss_root_mean_square)
bt_parts <- model_parts(explainer_bt,
    loss_function = loss_root_mean_square)

plot(logistic_parts, bt_parts, max_vars = 10)

```

### DALEX: Explain score

```r
onehouse_before <- predict_parts(explainer_bt,
    new_observation = select(dat_exp, -before1980) %>%
        dplyr::slice(13800), type = "break_down")

onehouse_after <- predict_parts(explainer_bt,
    new_observation = select(dat_exp, -before1980) %>%
        dplyr::slice(8), type = "break_down")

plot(onehouse_after) + plot(onehouse_before)

dat_train %>% dplyr::slice(c(8, 13800))
```
