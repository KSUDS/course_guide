# End of semester grade request letter

> The central argument here is that by acting as if grading motivates learning, we put both student and faculty energies in the wrong places. Does grading represent learning? Maybe … but mostly, grading motivates getting grades [ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1533-8525.2010.01195.x)

## Format

Your grade request letter should be no longer than one page and include the following elements.

1. Favorite skills and methods you learned during the class.
2. What do you think it means to be a data scientist in industry?
3. Suggestions for improvements with the course.
4. Your plans after graduation.
5. A detailed description of the elements you completed in the course with a grade request.

## Example grade request paragraph

Would you please not write in your grade request letter that you worked hard to justify a grade?  The specifications for each grade level are listed on [the syllabus](readme.md).  Your paragraph could follow the format of the following example.

> I completed all five projects in both languages after your feedback and enjoyed presenting my work to my team two times. You can find my three independent data projects in my Github repository (https://github.com/hathawayj). I was an active participant in all five readings and especially enjoyed the class conversation on the third article. You will find my other semester deliverables attached.
