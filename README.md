# Data Science Programming in R and Python

Materials for STAT 4490 Data Science Programming (Special Topics).  

## Course objectives

1. Use functions, data structures, and other programming constructs efficiently to process and find meaning in data.
2. Programmatically load data from various types of data sources, including files, databases, and remote services.
3. Use data manipulation libraries to perform straightforward analysis, produce charts, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms.
4. Use machine learning libraries to discover insights, make predictions, and interpret the success of these algorithms.
5. Use industry-leading tools to collaborate and share your work.

## Principles of data science teaching

You may want to read my [teaching philosophy](https://datathink.io/my-learning-manifesto-aka-teaching-philosophy/) to see how I will manage class. You may also find some joy in [reading student reviews of my courses at BYU-i](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2059480). 

I follow the listed principles of data science teaching as found in [A Guide to Teaching Data Science](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.07140.pdf). 

- Organize the course around a set of diverse projects
- Integrate computing into every aspect of the course
- Teach abstraction, but minimize reliance on mathematical notation
- Structure course activities to realistically mimic a data scientistâ€™s experience
- Demonstrate the importance of critical thinking/skepticism through examples

## Course communication

1. Slack is used heavily in the data science space.  We will use it in our course for most non-graded communication.  Please use your `kennesaw.edu` email to [join our space](https://join.slack.com/t/kssds/signup)
2. Github is the space where data science is shared.  Data scientists use Github for project collaboration and methadology dissemination.  We will use Github for our work collaborations and some course communication.
3. Kennesaw LMS for graded assignments.
