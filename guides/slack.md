## Slack 

Interacting with a team on large projects over multiple time zones necessitates technology.  Since the 1990s, email has been the electronic form of communication among business professionals.  It is messy, hard to organize, and almost impossible to allow new members into the conversation.  Slack (Searchable Log of All Communication and Knowledge) started to make a footprint in the early 2010s and is heavily used by the tech industry to communicate. It was initially built by gamers to facilitate large group conversations.  You can still feel that vibe a bit in its interface.

The most significant competitor is Microsoft Teams.  Microsoft has built a worthy competitor.  However, you can feel that teams was built using all of Microsoft's old software to compete with Slack.  It has tons of functionality.  However, it just doesn't quite have the same ease of use and feel.

[Join ksuds.slack.com](https://join.slack.com/t/ksuds/signup) with your `kennesaw.edu` email to connect with our class workspace. Slack has a set of [videos](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059976673-Slack-video-tutorials) that can help you get comfortable with the tool. You can also use the [quick start guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide) to familiarize yourself.

I highly recommend the apps over the web interface.  Please [download](https://slack.com/downloads/) them for your phone and computer.

### Class principles

1. __Ask questions, ask questions, ask questions.  Did I say ask questions?__ The secret to learning is figuring out how to ask straightforward questions.  Let's use this class to practice.
2. __Answer questions.__ The space is for our class to help each other.  I am not the fount of all knowledge.  Learning how to answer questions is also another valuable asset to gain for your career.
3. __Direct Message for personal stuff.__ If you want to ask someone about their favorite theology book or barbeque sauce, then send them a direct message. 
4. __Questions about the course are not personal.__ Try to stay in the public channels for programming and course questions.  
5. __I respond faster in Slack.__ If you have a question for me, then DM me on Slack or `@Hathaway` in a public channel within our workspace.
